Visual Output Guide
This document shows what the frontend application of the Sweet Shop Management System looks like when running in the browser.

1. Login Page
When a user first visits the application, they are presented with a clean, centered login form. The design is simple and inviting, using a pink color scheme to match the "sweet shop" theme.

Key Elements:

A prominent title: "Welcome Back!"

Input fields for "Email" and "Password".

A clear call-to-action button: "Login".

Error messages appear below the title if login fails.

2. Sweet Shop Dashboard
After successfully logging in, the user is directed to the main dashboard. This page displays all the available sweets in a responsive grid layout. The header contains the shop's name and a "Logout" button.

Key Elements of Each Sweet Card:

Name: The name of the sweet is displayed in a bold, eye-catching color (e.g., "Chocolate Fudge").

Category: The sweet's category is shown below the name (e.g., "Fudge").

Price: Clearly formatted price (e.g., "$5.99").

Stock Quantity: Shows the current number of items in stock.

Purchase Button:

If the sweet is in stock, a vibrant pink "Purchase" button is enabled.

If the quantity is zero, the button is disabled, grayed out, and displays "Out of Stock" to provide clear feedback to the user.
